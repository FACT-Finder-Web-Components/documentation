## Redirection
 The campaign returns a URL to which the request should be redirected when the campaign triggers1. This is particularly useful if you already have individual landing pages for specific categories or areas. Another area that is frequently handled using redirection campaigns comprises service-related searches, such as searches for terms and conditions or the site publisher information.
 
## Pushed Products
 Pushed Products are products that should be displayed in a particular way in the results, either as the first hit in the search results list or in a separate area of the page. Users compile products into a list as part of the campaign. This list is returned so that the selected products can then be handled accordingly. Depending on the campaign settings, these products can either be returned separately from the products found in the search results, or can be integrated directly into the search results product list on the FACT-Finder page. In the second scenario, the campaign would be returned with a blank Pushed Products list.

## Feedback Text
 Feedback text is returned unchanged as a list – together with the defined position key – with the appropriate campaign. The most common application for this type of campaign is to display a banner with the search result in order to draw the customer's attention to a brand line or a specific promotion.
