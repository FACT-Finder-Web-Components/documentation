Pagination is one of the most basic features for a online shop.
 When more records are listed in the search result as you want to display at once, 
 you can page trough the remaining result with this element.
 
## Page selection example 
You can use this as a full page selection widget with flexible configuration options.

You can just use the 'next' and 'previous' functionality of the paging for a simple information widget.
