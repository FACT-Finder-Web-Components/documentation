## Installation

---
Depending on whether you are using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), you have the following two ways of installing FACT-Finder Web Components.

### Using Node.js/bower or Node.js/npm

---
Add FACT-Finder Web Components as a dependency to the **bower.json** or **package.json**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ff-web-components": "https://github.com/FACT-Finder-Web-Components/ff-web-components.git#3.0.0"
  }
}
```
