## Ways to contribute

#### 1 - Creating an issue

We welcome you to [create an issue](https://github.com/FACT-Finder-Web-Components/documentation/issues/new)
anytime for the following reasons:

**Feature request:**
The documentation is missing information about a certain feature or
the given explanation/description is confusing.

If this is the case you should provide a link to the relevant page and/or
describe the information you would expect to find.

**Error:**
You found an inconsistency or error in the content of the documentation.

In this case you should definitely provide a link to the page containing
the error as well as a link to or short description of the correct information
or ways of obtaining the correct information.

**Unexpected Behavior:**
The app itself is behaving in an unexpected manner.
Instances of this might be anything from a broken link to the app crashing
on your machine.

In this case make sure to _use our template_ for reporting possible bugs.

#### 2 - Making your own changes

This is the preferred way of contributing since it reduces bureaucracy
and is therefore the fastest way of getting the change to go live so
other people can enjoy a better documentation.

Our documentation is `markdown` based. This means you don't have to be
able to code to make changes. You can even do it _in your browser_.
